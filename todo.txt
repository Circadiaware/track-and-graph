- remove data type from IDataPoint
	- Add pie chart exception for data source with no labels or too many labels (or generate random colours?)
	- Line graph data factory should check dataSampleProperties isDuration bool rather than feature type
	- Double check all tests are passing before you merge


- When you add functions you need to go back and change graph/stat config logic to account for them.
	- You need to gather the labels per feature in the graphstatinput view model

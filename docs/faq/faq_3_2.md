# Pie charts

Pie charts can be set up from the create graph or stat menu. The segments are simply one per label in the selected feature. The size of the segment is proportional to the number of data points with that label. The values of the data points are not used here it just a count of the labels. If you select a feature but can not see a pie chart it is probably because your data does not have any labels. Any data points without labels in the feature are filtered out.

# How do I start tracking something?

To begin tracking you will need to create a Tracker.

Type in the name of what you want to track and select an input style:

There are three styles of input you can choose: \n\n• Multiple choice requires you to manually set up predefined answers that will be presented to you as buttons when tracking.\n\n• Numerical will ask you to enter a number when tracking.\n\n• Time duration will ask you to enter an amount of time in hours, minutes and seconds when tracking. \n\nIf you add a default value you will not be asked for a value every time you tap the + button and your default value will be used instead. You can long press the + button to provide a value manually.

To create multiple choice answers click the + button at the bottom.

When you are happy with the setup click the FINISH button.

You should now see cards in your group. You can order them easily by holding down on the item you want to move and then dragging it to a new position.

Don\'t worry if you make a mistake you can always see, review and edit your tracking history by simply tapping on the card.

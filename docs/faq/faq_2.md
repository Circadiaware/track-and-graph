# How do I import / export what I have tracked?

To import/export only the tracked data in a group to a CSV use the menu buttons at the top:

![faq_image_2_1"](images/faq_image_2_1.png)


TODO import_icon

Use this button to import a csv into this group.

TODO export_icon

Use this button to export this groups tracked data to a csv.

The Backup & Restore option in the menu is slightly different. This will export and restore the entire database file containing all tracked data, graphs, reminders and notes. It is recommended that you backup your data regularly. The backup file is an un-encrypted Sqlite3 database file which can also be opened and modified using freely available software. However this is not recommended for non-technical users as you could break the integrity of the database.

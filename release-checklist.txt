1. Checkout a new release or hotfix branch if you haven't already

2. Make sure the docs links in the strings.xml are pointing to the new branch

3. Update the build.gradle version code and name

4. Build an aab for the release (using Android Studio)

5. Copy and paste a fastlane changelog file and add the changelog there e.g. 

	# cp fastlane/metadata/android/en-GB/changelogs/10403.txt fastlane/metadata/android/en-GB/changelogs/10404.txt

also make sure you update any other fastlane resources you want proliferated e.g. screenshots or app description.

6. Use fastlane to upload the new aab to the play store e.g. for alpha:

	# bundle exec fastlane supply --aab app/release/app-release.aab --track alpha

for beta:

	# bundle exec fastlane supply --aab app/release/app-release.aab --track beta

or for release:

	# bundle exec fastlane supply --aab app/release/app-release.aab

7. While this is uploading you can build an apk for the release (using Android Studio)

8. Commit everything and merge the release/hotfix branch back into master

9. Tag the commit e.g. rc-v1.0.0 for release candidate or v1.0.0 for release (you only want to tag once google play has accepted the upload) as F-droid uses these tags for its own releases

10. On GitHub create a new release using the new tag and attatch the apk to it. Also copy the release notes in here.

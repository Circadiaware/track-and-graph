1. Update the build.gradle version code and name

2. Build an aab for the release (using Android Studio)

3. Copy and paste a fastlane changelog file and add the changelog there e.g. 

	# cp fastlane/metadata/android/en-GB/changelogs/10403.txt fastlane/metadata/android/en-GB/changelogs/10404.txt

also make sure you update any other fastlane resources you want proliferated e.g. screenshots or app description.

4. Use fastlane to upload the new aab to the play store e.g.

	# bundle exec fastlane supply --aab app/release/app-release.aab --track beta

or for release

	# bundle exec fastlane supply --aab app/release/app-release.aab

5. Commit everything and tag the commit e.g. rc-v1.0.0 for release candidate or v1.0.0 for release (you only want to tag once google play has accepted the upload)

6. Build an apk for the release (using Android Studio)

7. On GitHub create a new release using the new tag and attatch the apk to it. Also copy the release notes in here.
